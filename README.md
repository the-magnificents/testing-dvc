# Using DVC in the context of TU Delft
## Why DVC (data version control)
- It allows us to work with git and datasets, as well as large files. It is a more flexible alternative to git LFS.
- It works based on git and uses a very similar command line interface
- It is progressive in the sense that is very easy to get started, has a very low level threshold

## Goals and wishlist
- We would like to use available storage infrastructure at TU Delft to store dvc files (Surfdrive, Projectdrive, VM)
- We would like to eventually host some training and develop some online educational material that researchers can use at TU delft to get started with such workflow

## For the Friday coding session- 16-04-2021 this is the proposed agenda
- Give a quick getting started demo with DVC
- Check the status of what we have tried and what we have learned
- Discuss open issues/cards in the board
- Discuss lessons learned
- Discuss next steps and tasks
